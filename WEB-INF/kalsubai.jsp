<p><h4>
   Kalsubai Trek to Highest Peak of Maharashtra 
Kalsubai Peak Trek with a height of 1646 meters or 5400 Feet is famous as the highest peak in Maharashtra. Kalsubai Mountain lies in the Sahyadri mountain range falling under Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary. Kalsubai Height being the highest peak commands a beautiful view. Since Bhandardara Dam and Kalsubai Peak are extremely famous, enough effort has been made to make this trek easy. There are steel railings, chains, and ladders at places where it is difficult to climb.
